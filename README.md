# Who am I?
## **Joshua Stanley: A Versatile Professional in Tech and Business**

With a robust foundation spanning over two decades, my career has been a blend of deep technical expertise and strategic business management. As a seasoned .NET Developer and Systems Administrator, I've navigated the complexities of software development and systems management, honing skills that are critical in today's technology-driven environments.

Pursuing a new chapter in my professional life, I've transitioned into the role of an Account Executive, where I leverage my unique background to offer insights not common in the field. My ability to not just analyze data and make informed business decisions, but also to develop the very tools, software, and systems necessary for data collection and analysis, sets me apart. This multidisciplinary approach enables me to deliver complete solutions that bridge the gap between technology and business operations.

#### Calendar Library | April 2024
I often design analyitcs for consumption either for myself or others. The foundation of these types of applications is a calendar system. Often different entities will have different starts to fical years and applications need a way to translate and normalize these dates accross different data sets.

In this library I make use of two common patterns. The Factory Pattern to build the core Calendar model that contains the data and the buisiness logic pertaining to the data. The second pattern is the Repository pattern to abstract away the complexities of the database operations. This repo implementation leverages an abstraction of DataAccess so I can have a mockdata implementation.

*NOTE: I added a simple console project to the class library for demo purposes.*
