# Who am I?
**Joshua Stanley: A Versatile Professional in Tech and Business**

With a robust foundation spanning over two decades, my career has been a blend of deep technical expertise and strategic business management. As a seasoned .NET Developer and Systems Administrator, I've navigated the complexities of software development and systems management, honing skills that are critical in today's technology-driven environments.

Embarking on a new chapter of my professional life, I've transitioned into the role of an Account Manager, where I leverage my unique background to offer insights not common in the field. My ability to not just analyze data and make informed business decisions, but also to develop the very tools, software, and systems necessary for data collection and analysis, sets me apart. This multidisciplinary approach enables me to deliver complete solutions that bridge the gap between technology and business strategy.
